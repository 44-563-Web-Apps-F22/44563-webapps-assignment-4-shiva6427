<h4>THE GONDOLIERS</h4>
<h5>
ACT II</h5>
<h5> Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h5>
<h5>
<b>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.</b>
Marco and Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones, occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.
The Gondoliers are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank, etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various degrees. 
All are enjoying themselves without reference to social distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.

   CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

    Of happiness the very pith
                   In Barataria you may see:
    A monarchy that's tempered with
                   Republican Equality.
    This form of government we find
    The beau ideal of its kind—
    A despotism strict combined
                   With absolute equality!

                 MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

    Two kings, of undue pride bereft,
                   Who act in perfect unity,
    Whom you can order right and left
                   With absolute impunity.
    Who put their subjects at their ease
    By doing all they can to please!
    And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,
                   Seize every opportunity.

CHORUS.   Of happiness the very pith, etc.

<h6>MAR.</h6>  <p>Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good feeling.</p>
<h6>ALL.</h6>  <p>We heard you.</p>
<h6>MAR.</h6>  <p>We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with sentiments so charmingly expressed.</p>
<h6>ALL.</h6>  <p>That's all right.</p>
<h6>GIU.</h6>  <p>At the same time there is just one little grievance that we should like to ventilate.</p>
<h6>ALL (angrily).</h6> <p> What?</p>
<h6>GIU.</h6> <p> Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we are to act as one person.</p>
<h6>GIORGIO.</h6>  <p>Exactly.</p>
<h6>GIU.</h6> <p> Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point of fact, two persons.</p>
<h6>ANNIBALE.</h6>  <p>Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.</p>
